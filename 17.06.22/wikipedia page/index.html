          <h3>Kalākaua, King of Hawaii</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="para">
          The 1881 world tour of King Kalākaua (pictured) made him the first
          monarch to circumnavigate the globe. His agenda was to negotiate
          contract labor for the Kingdom of Hawaii's sugar plantations, with
          hopes of saving the dwindling Native Hawaiian population by drawing
          immigration from Asia-Pacific nations. Rumors circulated that the King
          secretly intended to use the trip to sell the Hawaiian Islands. He
          visited American legislators, had an audience with Pope Leo XIII in
          Rome, and met with European and Asian heads of state. In between
          negotiations, Kalākaua and his companions visited tourist sites and
          attended local Masonic lodge meetings. As a result of his visit with
          Thomas Edison, Iolani Palace became the first building in Hawaii with
          electric lighting. The King's amiable personality generated worldwide
          goodwill, and he succeeded in increasing Hawaii's labor force with
          Japanese workers. Their arrival was commemorated a century later with
          a new statue of Kalākaua in Waikiki.
